### Interfaces in Java

An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields and constructors. The methods in interfaces are abstract by default, meaning they do not have a body, and must be implemented by classes that choose to implement the interface.

### Key Features of Interfaces

1. **Abstract Methods**
2. **Default Methods**
3. **Static Methods**
4. **Constants**
5. **Inheritance in Interfaces**
6. **Implementing Interfaces**
7. **Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces**
8. **Marker Interfaces**
9. **Functional Interfaces**

### 1. Abstract Methods

An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation. Interfaces can only declare abstract methods (unless they are default or static).

**Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}
```

### 2. Default Methods

Default methods are methods defined in interfaces with a default implementation. They were introduced in Java 8 to provide backward compatibility for old interfaces so that they can have new methods without affecting the classes that implement these interfaces.

**Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
    
    default void breathe() {
        System.out.println("This animal breathes.");
    }
}
```

### 3. Static Methods

Static methods in interfaces are similar to static methods in classes. They belong to the interface rather than any instance and can be called directly using the interface name.

**Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
    
    static void showInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is an Animal interface.");
    }
}
```

### 4. Constants

Interfaces can declare constants, which are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`.

**Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
    int LEGS = 4;  // Equivalent to public static final int LEGS = 4;
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}
```

### 5. Inheritance in Interfaces

Interfaces can extend other interfaces, and a class that implements the child interface must implement all methods from both the child and parent interfaces.

**Example:**

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

interface Pet extends Animal {
    void play();
}
```

### 6. Implementing Interfaces

A class implements an interface using the `implements` keyword. The class must provide implementations for all abstract methods defined in the interface.

**Example:**

**File: Main.java**

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The dog eats.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("The dog sleeps.");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();
        myDog.sleep();
    }
}
```

### 7. Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces

A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing multiple inheritance. This is one of the main purposes of interfaces, as Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes.

**Example:**

**File: Main.java**

```java
interface CanFly {
    void fly();
}

interface CanSwim {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements CanFly, CanSwim {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("The duck flies.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("The duck swims.");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Duck myDuck = new Duck();
        myDuck.fly();
        myDuck.swim();
    }
}
```

### 8. Marker Interfaces

A marker interface is an interface with no methods or constants. It is used to indicate that a class possesses some property or should be treated in a certain way. Common examples include `Serializable`, `Cloneable`, and `Remote`.

**Example:**

**File: Main.java**

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

class Person implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30);
        System.out.println("Person name: " + person.getName());
        System.out.println("Person age: " + person.getAge());
    }
}
```

### 9. Functional Interfaces

A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. They are used primarily for lambda expressions and method references. The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used to mark an interface as a functional interface.

**Example:**

**File: Main.java**

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello(String name);
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting greeting = (name) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        greeting.sayHello("John");
    }
}
```

### Summary

- **Abstract Methods**: Methods declared without a body in interfaces.
- **Default Methods**: Methods with a body in interfaces, providing default implementation.
- **Static Methods**: Methods that belong to the interface rather than instances, callable using the interface name.
- **Constants**: Fields in interfaces are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`.
- **Inheritance in Interfaces**: Interfaces can extend other interfaces.
- **Implementing Interfaces**: Classes implement interfaces and provide concrete implementations for abstract methods.
- **Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces**: A class can implement multiple interfaces, supporting multiple inheritance.
- **Marker Interfaces**: Interfaces with no methods, used to indicate a property or behavior.
- **Functional Interfaces**: Interfaces with a single abstract method, used with lambda expressions and method references.
